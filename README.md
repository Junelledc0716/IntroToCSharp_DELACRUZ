# PRELIM 1 - Codac Logistics Fuel Monitoring System


## Project Overview:

The Codac Logistics Fuel Monitoring System is a C# console-based application designed to track, analyze, and report a delivery vehicle’s weekly fuel consumption and performance. The system collects driver information, records daily fuel expenses, calculates efficiency metrics, and generates a structured audit report for evaluation purposes.

his project demonstrates the practical application of fundamental programming concepts in C#, including input validation, arrays, loops, conditionals, formatting, and financial computation.



## Objectives:

Collect and validate driver profile information.

Record five (5) days of fuel expenses.

Compute total and average fuel costs.

Calculate fuel efficiency based on total distance and fuel spent.

Determine whether the driver stayed within the weekly budget.

Generate a clean and professional audit report.



## Features:

✔ Input validation using while loops and TryParse

✔ One-dimensional array for fuel expense tracking

✔ Conditional logic for efficiency rating classification

✔ Boolean evaluation for budget checking

✔ Structured and color-formatted console output

✔ Financial calculations using decimal for accuracy



## Core Programming Concepts Used:

- Data Types

- string

- decimal

- double

- bool

- decimal[] (array)



## Control Structures:

while loops for validation

for loops for iteration

if-else statements for decision making

Formatting

Currency formatting (:C)

Fixed decimal formatting (:F2)

Console color styling



## Program Flow:

Driver Profile & Distance Validation

Collects driver name, weekly budget, and total distance.

Ensures valid numeric input before proceeding.

Fuel Expense Tracking

Stores 5-day fuel expenses in an array.

Calculates total fuel spent.

Performance Analysis

Computes average daily fuel cost.

Calculates fuel efficiency.

Determines efficiency rating.

Checks if within budget.

Audit Report

Displays all collected and computed data.

Presents a structured financial summary.



## How to Run:

Open the project in Visual Studio.

Make sure the code is inside Program.cs.

Click Run or press Ctrl + F5.

Follow the on-screen prompts.



## Sample Output Includes:
